HOW TO PLAY
===========

To play the 6x5 version of connect-4, put the file "connect4_6x5.new" in the same directory as the Python source files.

You can either generate this file yourself by running the solver, or download a compressed version here:

https://data.jigsaw.nl/connect4/connect4_6x5.new.xz

Assuming your Python has the PyQt5 package installed, and you have the "connect4_6x5.new" file accessible in uncompressed form,
you can now start the GUI by running the "connect4-gui.py" program.
