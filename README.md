CONNECT4 solver and perfect-play GUI
====================================

This project contains code to strongly solve the game of CONNECT-4.

The "solver" subdirectory contains the code that generates a
perfect-play database.

The "gui" subdirectory contains the Qt-based GUI that allows
play against the perfect-play database, showing the consequence
of each move. For now, this is based on the 6x5 board.
